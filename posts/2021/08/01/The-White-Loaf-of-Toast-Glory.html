    <h1 id="title">The White Loaf of Toast Glory</h1>

    <p id="excerpt">This is the most basic of loaves. The only thing that sets this a part from the most ancient of dough (sourdough) is the oil and time. This consisted of the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g of Bread Flour</li>
        <li>9g of Active Dry Yeast</li>
        <li>10g of Salt</li>
        <li>60ml of Avocado Oil</li>
        <li>270ml of Water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I love the fact that I don't actually have to activate this yeast. Just throwing it in with everything gets the process started. Unlike my other experiments, this dough likes being a singular entity. The chicken aide is a beast when it comes to joining all of these ingredients together.</p>

    <p>The white loaf dough is also a stickier dough than my previous loaves. The bread flour really produces that great gluten structure right off the bat and only needs a little bit of kneading after coming out of the mixer.</p>

    <p>The first proof was a full hour. I find it interesting how the white loaf continues to smell like flour throughout the proofing process whereas the other loaves start smelling like their final the final loaf a lot earlier in the process.</p>

    <p>I did the standard transition that I've been experimenting with from the first to the second proof. As you can see, I squish the loaf down into the tin after removing as much air from the first proof as feels right. I feel like this might be developing the flavor more but who am I kidding, that's just something I've heard or read about flavor.</p>

    <p>The second proof was just over of an hour at one and fifteen before I popped it in the oven at 425ºF for 33 minutes. I've found that my over at 425ºF needs a little longer than I would expect for a loaf like this (my expectations are closer to 30 minutes).</p>

    <p>Then came the sadness. In my eagerness to release the loaf from its tin, I cracked the crust. Luckily, the loaf was still pretty warm so I just lumped the broken bit onto the end and it was all good.</p>

    <p>Overall, this a great toast or sandwich loaf. The broken corner was sad but didn't effect the taste in the slightest. It did make the first several slices a bit of a pain to cut, but that's the price I pay for being hasty. I've definitely learned my lesson on that front.</p>

    <p>Next week, I'm continuing with my exploration of tin loaves. Maybe soon I'll do something different but no promises.</p>
