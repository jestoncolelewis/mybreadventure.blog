    <h1>Except with Butter This Time</h1>

    <p>Welcome back! As promised, I'm continuing down the road of tin breads. This one has a slightly different twist to
        it. Instead of oil for the fat that we usually have in these breads we have….. butter!! There are a couple other
        differences but that's the one I'm most excited about. Let's take a look at the ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g of Bread Flour</li>
        <li>12g of Active Dry Yeast</li>
        <li>10g of Salt</li>
        <li>57g of Butter (salted, because only monsters by unsalted butter)</li>
        <li>290ml of Water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So this loaf killed the rest of the active dry yeast I had. Next week will be an exciting adventure into new yeast land! I didn't have enough butter hanging around in my dish so I had to quickly (like 5 seconds) soften the butter in the microwave before adding it to the flour, yeast, and salt. I cut it into tabs, maybe I'll try cubes in the future?</p>

    <p>Anywho, this dough came together crazy fast despite me slowly adding in the water. It is quite the sticky dough with the extra 20ml of water from the previous recipe. Another way that could be said is 2cl of water but nobody uses centiliter… or deciliter….</p>

    <p>After removing the dough from the chicken aide, I gave it a couple folds with my hands to make sure it had a good gluten structure. You know I used that window pain test! The first proof clocked in at a little under an hour and the dough was so nice and billowy.</p>

    <p>Unlike the last loaf, and the ones that came before. I did my best to keep as much of the air in the loaf as possible while shaping for the tin. As you can probably see, there are some gaps around the corners of the tin where the dough isn't touching the sides (scandalous!). Again, just under an hour and the loaf was ready for that toasty warm oven life.</p>

    <p>For 35 minutes it cooked, or baked, at 450ºF to come out this beautiful golden brown. Having learned my lesson from last week's loaf, I took my time getting this beauty out of the tin (it came out a lot easier). The strangest this to me is the bubbly pattern on the lower crust. After I put the loaf in the oven, I reread the instructions and I forgot to put cuts down the top so maybe that's it?</p>

    <p>Maybe it's the butter, maybe I'm getting better at bread, but either way, this is a good loaf. Once I have someone else to bake for, this will be a staple every week for toast and sandwiches. I think there's only one modification I would make. I want to see if a skinnier tin would make a taller loaf.</p>

    <p>Next week you ask? This but with whole wheat!</p>
