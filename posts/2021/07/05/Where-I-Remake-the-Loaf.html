    <h1>Where I Remake the Loaf</h1>

    <p>After last week's loaf, I wanted to make it properly. I wanted to prove that the lack of revitalized yeast was the reason I didn't get a nice rise out of the loaf. Turns out, that just wasn't true.</p>

    <p>Like last week, this is a 500 gram loaf comprising of 200g of rye, 200g of whole wheat, 100g of unbleached white flour, 60 ml of avocado oil, 17g (oops) of salt, 9g of yeast, and 300ml of water.</p>

    <p>All of this combined nicely and developed into a hearty dough that was easy to shape for the first proof. Have I mentioned how nice it is to get that initial combining done by a machine? Sometimes it feels a little lazy but overall its just satisfying to watch.</p>

    <p>I gave my first proof a solid fifty minutes. Judging from my eye, it gained quite a bit of size. I would say an easy double.</p>

    <p>I dumped it out of the bowl and got a decent amount of air out of it before squeezing it in the loaf tin. I may have added a bit too much a roll to it as the final loaf had some strange curves to it. I did a good job of not notating the end of the second proof so thatâ€™s something I'll have to improve upon. I went for the eyeball method of seeing just a bit of the dough above the tin rim.</p>

    <p>In closing, I think this is just a dense loaf that doesn't get much bigger. I want to try it one more time and play with the second proof. See if I can get the flavor to mature and the loaf to grow just a bit more. This loaf is tasty (especially with butter) and will be one I come back to on a consistent basis.</p>

    Next, I'll be turning to a plain old white bread. The whitest of white breads.
