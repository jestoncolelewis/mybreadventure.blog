    <h1 id="title">The Journey of George</h1>

    <p id="excerpt">Ok, it has been a minute. I'm kind of ignoring the loaves I made a couple weeks ago that just… weren't good. We just won't talk about that. Anywho, I decided to revisit my favorite recipe from way back when, the basic white loaf with butter. The major difference is the final look of the bread, a lot more country, a lot less grocery store.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g white</li>
        <li>270ml water</li>
        <li>57g butter</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>10g active dry yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It was much colder in the house this go around, so my initial proof took quite a lot longer. Starting this loaf felt like a renewal. Taking the first bite off the fresh loaf, reminded me of why I enjoy making my own bread.</p>

    <p>I'm pretty sure the recipe asks you to slowly add water but I missed the memo this go around. I just threw everything together into the mixing bowl and told the chicken aide to take it slow. It came together nice and easy but it did seem that some of the butter didn't initially incorporate.</p>

    <p>I took a few extra minutes to check the gluten structure and knead the dough just a bit to get those last pieces of butter to melt before the first proof. The dough was nice a taught. The first proof was a long one, totaling an hour and twenty two minutes. This is also where my wife named this loaf George.</p>

    <p>I think the main issue I made this go around was compressing the dough on the table instead of in the basket. It made a lot of weaknesses in the skin of the dough. Creating some strange breaks in the final crust. I decided to use a proofing basket and get a more rustic final shape. The second proof was a quick one, I can't wait for the future where I have a proofing drawer.</p>

    <p>I threw a quick cross design on top to give the escaping gas somewhere to go and hopes that it would create a nice design. I set an initial timer of thirty minutes at 450ºF but ended up going an extra five minutes to get the interior to 200ºF.</p>

    <p>Like I mentioned earlier, the imperfections in the skin of the dough made some but it did not effect the taste one bit. I really like the look of the country loaf. Looking forward to continued experimentation on the shaping front. Next week will be an attempt at improving this loaf and maybe I'll do two kinds of loaves.</p>
